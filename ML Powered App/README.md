### Installing ðŸ”§

Step-by-step guide to setting up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone repo-url`
2. **Install the requirements**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Environment Configuration

Important steps to correctly set up your environment, including creating a `.env` file with the correct PostgreSQL database connection details.

#### Resolving PostgreSQL Connection Issues

To resolve database connection issues like the `psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL: role "root_user" does not exist`:

1. **Create the Role**: If `root_user` is your intended database user, create this role in PostgreSQL with:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE root_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';

Replace 'your_password' with a secure password.

Grant Permissions: Grant necessary permissions to root_user, for instance:

```ALTER ROLE root_user CREATEDB;```
Adjust based on your project's requirements.

Verify Role: Use \du in PostgreSQL to list all roles and check that root_user is present with correct permissions.

Update Connection String: Make sure the .env file or application's database connection details correctly reference root_user and the password.

Restart PostgreSQL Service: Apply configurations by restarting the PostgreSQL service, typically with:
```sudo service postgresql restart```

Troubleshoot: If issues persist, recheck connection parameters including database name, host, port, and credentials for errors or typos.
